  #### Getting Started

  By default redis runs on port 6379 on the initial master and slave servers.
  A sentinel is configured on each server, running on port 26379 by default.
  All redis instances are configured to require password authentication.
  The password is available in the `redis_password` output. If you want to test
  with `redis-cli` remember to use the `-a` option and supply the password.

  #### Logging in via SSH
  The private key provided in the passwords section can be used to login as
  root via SSH. We have an article on how to use these keys with [Mac OS X and
  Linux](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-linuxmac)
  as well as [Windows using
  PuTTY](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-windows).
